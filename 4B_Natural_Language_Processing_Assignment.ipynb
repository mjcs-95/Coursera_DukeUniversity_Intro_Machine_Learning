    "For example, the AG News dataset contains text from 127600 online news articles, from 4 different categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology.\n",
    "AG News is typically used for topic classification: given an unseen news article, we're interested in predicting the topic.\n",
    "For this assignment, you'll be training several models on the AG News dataset.\n",
    "Unlike the quick example we trained in Notebook 4A, however, we're going to *learn* the word embeddings.\n",
